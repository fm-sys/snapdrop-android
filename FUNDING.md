<h1 align="center">Support Snapdrop for Android </h1>

<p align="center">This Android App is one of my hobby projects. Even though I'm really happy that you want to support me, I would feel bad if I would accept donations. I have no running costs and enjoy working on this project. If you want to support the app, you are more than welcomed to help with translations and/or submit code contributions.</p>
<p align="center">If you still want to donate some money, I ask you to rather support the Snapdrop Community via a donation to <a href="https://github.com/RobinLinus/" rel="nofollow">@RobinLinus</a>, the inventor and maintainer of https://snapdrop.net. This app causes a not inconsiderable load on his Servers, so I ask you to support him instead.</p>
