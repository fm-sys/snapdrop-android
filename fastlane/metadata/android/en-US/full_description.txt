<hh2>Introduction</hh2>
<a href="https://snapdrop.net">Snapdrop</a> and <a href="https://pairdrop.net">PairDrop</a> for Android are clients for free and open-source local file-sharing solutions.

Are you ever in a situation where you need to quickly transfer files from your phone to your PC? If so, this is the app for you.

<hh2>Awkward Technologies</hh2>
Because of its speed and simplicity, Snapdrop is superior to these file-sharing methods:
<ul>
<li>USB? - Old fashioned!</li>
<li>Bluetooth? - Much too cumbersome and slow!</li>
<li>E-mail? - Please, not another email I must write to myself!</li>
</ul>

<hh2>Enter Snapdrop!</hh2>
Snapdrop (as well as the enhanced version <i>PairDrop</i>) is a browser-based local file-sharing solution. It's like Apple's Airdrop, but not exclusively for Apple devices. It runs on Windows, Linux, Android, iPhone, Mac â€” no problem at all!

<hh2>Integration With Android OS</hh2>
Even though Snapdrop and PairDrop can be totally browser based, they fully integrate with the Android operating system; meaning, you can quickly send files directly from Android apps via the <i>Share</i> function.

<hh2>Help Us Improve The World</hh2>
Thanks to their radical simplicity, Snapdrop and PairDrop for Android make the everyday lives of thousands of users easier. As an open-source project, we don't have any commercial interests but want to make the world a little bit better. So, join and see yourself!
